- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cshoben
- ðŸ‘€ From a scientific perspective, Iâ€™m interested in genomics. Particularly how structural genetic variation (like repetitive DNA, insertions, etc.) contribute to traits and 
        phenotypes. I have a soft spot for intergenic DNA regions and get even more excited about genomic variation as we zoom out and begin to consider 
        DNA conformational changes, 3D genome, and nuclear organization. 
      From a computational perspective, I'm most interested in software development and data analysis (these are both active learning areas). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using Unix/bash and Golang for my research. I have at least some level of exprience with the following lanuages: R, Java, Python, HTML. I am also comfortable with git, bash, and linux OS.
